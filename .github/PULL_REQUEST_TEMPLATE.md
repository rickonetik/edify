## PR Artifacts (EPIC 1+)

**REQUIRED**: Every PR for EPIC 1 Stories MUST include:

1. **Git commit hash:**

   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```

2. **Link to GitHub Actions run** (if PR triggers CI)

3. **Copy-paste stdout of three commands:**

   ```bash
   pnpm verify
   pnpm test:foundation
   pnpm audit:architecture
   ```

4. **Manual smoke test results** (actual curl output, not just "works"):
   - `curl -i http://localhost:3001/health` (showing `x-request-id` header)
   - `curl -i http://localhost:3001/docs` returns `200` in dev, `404` in prod
   - `curl -i http://localhost:3001/nope` returns `404` with unified error format

**Without these artifacts, PR is NOT considered complete.**
