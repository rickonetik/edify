# Rules (tracked-lms)

- **One Story = One PR**
- **No scope creep** (no refactors/renames/reformatting/deps unless required)
- **Foundation frozen from EPIC 1+** (no infra/tooling/CI/dev-loop changes)
- **No structure changes** (no moving/renaming folders/packages)

- `packages/shared` is **SSoT**
  - **no deep imports** (`@tracked/shared/src/*`)
  - **no wildcard paths**
  - import only from `@tracked/shared`

- WebApp: `apps/webapp/src/shared/ui/*` = **pure UI** (no fetching, no business logic)

- Before reporting: **run `pnpm verify`**, attach artifacts, **stop after DoD**

## Terminal protocol (mandatory)
Run **everything** via:
```bash
pnpm run:protocol <command>
```
