# Overview
One Story = One PR
No scope creep (no refactors/renames/deps)
Foundation frozen in EPIC 1+
No structure changes
Shared is SSoT; no deep imports; no wildcard paths
UI kit (apps/webapp/src/shared/ui/*) has no fetching/business logic
Pages/features may use hooks/fetcher
Run verify/test/audit and attach artifacts
Stop after DoD
