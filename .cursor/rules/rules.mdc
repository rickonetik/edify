# Overview
Mandatory rules for all changes in tracked-lms. Follow them strictly to avoid architecture drift.
- Epic order is mandatory; see docs/runbooks/epics-outline.md
- Do not implement outside the current Story scope

# Project Rules (tracked-lms) — Mandatory

## Prime Directive (Scope Control)
- Follow scope boundaries strictly.
- If a task does not explicitly ask for it, DO NOT do it.
- No refactors, no renames, no dependency additions, no folder reshuffles unless explicitly requested by the current Story.
- If requirements are unclear or missing inputs, DO NOT guess. Ask for clarification or implement the smallest safe stub consistent with the Story.

## Execution Mode (PR Discipline)
- Work on exactly ONE Story per PR.
- Keep changes minimal and localized to the Story scope.
- End every PR with a final summary:
  1) changed files list
  2) commands run + results
  3) manual QA checklist results
  4) artifacts produced (logs/screens/recordings)

## Repo Structure Invariants (Do Not Break)
Do not change these paths without an explicit Story:
- apps/api
- apps/webapp
- apps/bot
- packages/shared
- infra
- docs
- tools
- .cursor
Do not rename packages, tsconfig files, or workspace structure unless the Story explicitly demands it.

## Configuration / Infra Safety
- Do NOT modify tooling configs (tsconfig/eslint/prettier/vite/turbo/docker-compose/github actions) unless the Story explicitly asks.
- If a config change is required, explain why and keep it minimal.
- Never change ports, service names, or env keys without explicit requirement.

## Code Ownership by Layer
### WebApp
- UI components live under: apps/webapp/src/**
- Data fetching is forbidden inside UI components.
- Data access must go through:
  - apps/webapp/src/shared/api/*
  - apps/webapp/src/shared/hooks/*
- No business logic in UI. UI only renders states and triggers actions via hooks.

### API
- Domain modules live under: apps/api/src/modules/<domain>
- Cross-cutting code lives under: apps/api/src/common/*
- Controllers must be thin: controllers delegate to services.
- Every endpoint must use the unified error format (no ad-hoc JSON).

### Bot
- Bot features live under: apps/bot/src/*
- Validate env at boot. Never start with missing BOT_TOKEN.
- Bot must not contain core business logic; it calls API or queues jobs.

### Shared (Single Source of Truth)
- packages/shared is the single source of truth for:
  - DTO/contracts
  - error codes and error response shape
  - env schemas
Never duplicate enums/DTOs/error codes in apps.

**TypeScript Paths Rule**: Do not add tsconfig paths for `@tracked/shared/*` or any deep paths. Only `@tracked/shared` root mapping is allowed. Wildcard paths are forbidden and will break typecheck without build.

## Dependencies Policy (Strict)
- Do NOT add new libraries unless the Story explicitly says so.
- Prefer existing dependencies already in the repo.
- If a new dependency is unavoidable:
  - explain why
  - list at least 1 alternative
  - keep it to 1 library max for the Story

## Database / Migrations Discipline
- DB schema changes are allowed only when explicitly required by the Story.
- Migrations must be deterministic and committed.
- Do not introduce extra columns/tables “for future” unless requested.

## Environment Variables
- All apps must validate env on startup using shared schemas.
- Do not hardcode ports. Use env.
- Do not introduce new env keys unless required by the Story.

## Logging, Errors, and Security
- API must set/propagate x-request-id and include traceId in error responses.
- API errors must return:
  { statusCode, code, message, traceId, details? }
- Never leak secrets in logs.
- Do not store credentials, tokens, or secrets in code or git.
- Storage links:
  - Do not store raw public S3/MinIO URLs in DB unless explicitly allowed by the Story.
  - Prefer storing object keys + generating signed URLs on read (when in scope).

## Formatting & Linting
- Keep formatting consistent with repo configs.
- Do not reformat unrelated files.
- Changes must be minimal and localized.

## Git Discipline
- Branch naming: type/scope-short (e.g., chore/infra-compose)
- One Story = one PR.
- Commit messages should be conventional style when possible.

## Quality Gates Enforcement

### Before Starting Any New Story

1. **Run `pnpm verify`**
   - If red → fix first, stop
   - Do not proceed with new Story if verify fails

2. **Never modify unrelated files to make verify pass**
   - Fix the actual issue, not symptoms
   - Maintain scope discipline

### Quality Gates Check

The `pnpm verify` command runs:
- Workspace integrity check
- Deep imports check (no `@tracked/shared/src/*`)
- Lint (errors block, warnings OK)
- Typecheck
- Build

See [docs/runbooks/quality-gates.md](../docs/runbooks/quality-gates.md) for details.

## Stop Condition
After completing the current Story DoD and Manual QA, STOP.
Do not start the next Story.
